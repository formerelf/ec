![image-right]({{ "/assets/images/Small Headshot.jpg" | absolute_url}}){: .align-right} Elaine Cunningham is a history geek and former music teacher, an avid reader with a lifelong interest in mythology and folklore. This would explain why many of her characters are bards and the rest are elves. (An exaggeration, but only a slight one...) 

By day, Elaine is the executive director of the Providence Singers, a symphonic choir that performs with the Rhode Island Philharmonic and other ensembles.
