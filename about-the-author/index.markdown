![image-right]({{ "/assets/images/Small Headshot.jpg" | absolute_url}}){: .align-right} Elaine Cunningham is a history geek and former music teacher, an avid reader with a lifelong interest in mythology and folklore. This would explain why many of her characters are bards and the rest are elves. (An exaggeration, but only a slight one...) 

In real life, she is the executive director of the Providence Singers, a choir affiliated with the Rhode Island Philharmonic. 

Readers are invited to join her [facebook friends list ](http://www.facebook.com/elaine.cunningham) and follow her on [twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/e_cunningham).
