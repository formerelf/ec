![image-right]({{ "/assets/images/Small Headshot.jpg" | absolute_url}}){: .align-right} Elaine Cunningham is a history geek and former music teacher, an avid reader with a lifelong interest in mythology and folklore. She's bringing all these favorite things to her novel-in-progress, set in a fantasy version of Elizabethan England. She spends much of her time these days in the 16th century, preparing for the 1567-68 revival of the Eisteddfod bard competition, with occasional incursions into the Faerie realm. 

In real life, she performs with the Providence Singers, a choir affiliated with the Rhode Island Philharmonic, and occasionally play the celtic harp.
