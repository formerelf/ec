[![](http://www.elainecunningham.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Categories-Vector-Art-FINAL-296x300.jpg)](http://www.elainecunningham.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Categories-Vector-Art-FINAL.jpg)Three years ago, I started a serious exploration of habits--what they are, why they matter, how to build them, and how to change them. This became a personal obsession and a family project. We've been working on a web app called GIDIG that's a toolkit for habit acquisition.

GIDIG is currently in closed beta testing. Â If you'd like to learn more, visit the **[website ](http://www.gidig.com)**or check out the**[ blog](http://blog.gidig.com).**
