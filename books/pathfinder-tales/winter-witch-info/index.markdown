![]({{ "/assets/Winter-Witch-188x300.jpg" | absolute_url }})Snowbound Irrisen is home to a race of witches descended from the mysterious Baba Yaga. They do as they please, take what and whom they want--including  a magically-gifted young girl from a neighboring land. No one is powerful enough to challenge them.

There is, however, one person _stubborn_ enough.

Ellasif, a shieldmaiden from the Land of the Linnorm Kings, will do whatever it takes to get her sister back. That includes putting up with Declan Avari, a magic academy dropout and aspiring artist whose most notable accomplishments are bawdy flip books and forged treasure maps. But something about Declan has drawn the attention of the winter witches, and Ellasif could use an ally...or a bargaining chip.

_Winter Witch_ is a sword & sorcery tale, a stand-alone fantasy adventure in the world of Golarian, the setting of the Pathfinder RPG and Pathfinder Tales novels.  It was written with Dave Gross, who has written several very good solo novels in this setting.
