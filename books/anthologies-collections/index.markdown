### **Anthologies edited**


**My only editorial project to date is a micro-press anthology of short fiction inspired by Lilith mythology.**


![Lilith Unbound](http://www.elainecunningham.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Lilith-Unbound-195x300.jpg)“Bound is the bewitching Lilith…” So begins an ancient incantation for protection against the demon Lilith. Lilith, the First Woman, the wife Adam discarded when she refused to submit to his will. Lilith, the goddess of storms, the night bird. Lilith, the succubus who haunts men’s dreams and steals their souls. Lilith the child-slaying monster, the mother of demons. Lilith the feminist poster girl. Lilith the muse.


The stories in this collection set Lilith free to explore all these aspects. Mike Resnick and Lawrence Schimel portray her as the ultimate shiksa. Nisi Shawl goes looking for her in the savannas of Africa. J. Robert King finds her in the changeling babies of a modern world. Ed Greenwood delivers her in a mysterious and seductive painting. T. L. Morganfield melds Lilith lore with Native American mythology. Jackie Kessler explores her succubus origins. Eirene Donohue twines a handful of Lilith themes into a tale of storm-chased young girl. Within these pages Lilith is a vengeful asteroid, a self-help guru, a divorce lawyer, and much, much more…
