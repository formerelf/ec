Salvatore, an avid online gamer, got the ball rolling for a series of novels set in the word of EverQuest.  The series was short-lived: **_The Blood Red Harp_ **was the fourth and final novel.





*****


The dark elf vampire who rules Castle Mistmore is searching for a small red harp. Chanzoon Nexus, necromancer, wants to know why. He has the harp in his possession; now he needs a bard who can play it well enough to uncover its secrets. But Faydwer's bards consider harps to be quaint folk instruments, unworthy of their attention.

Elizerain grew up with a harp in her hands. A merry, fun-loving wood elf, she collects ballads like other adventurers collect treasure. If these story-songs are entertaining, she doesn't care if they're accurate.  That was before a necromancer's curse gave her a choice: learn the true stories behind her ballads, or die screaming.

One such ballad features her new red harp. Intent on her search, surrounded by deadly enemies and treacherous alliances, Elizerain doesn't realize that the real danger may be the harp itself.
