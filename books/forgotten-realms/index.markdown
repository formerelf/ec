**Graphic Novel Adaptation**

[![The Great Hunt]({{ "/assets/The-Great-Hunt-194x300.jpg" | absolute_url }})]({{ "/assets/The-Great-Hunt.jpg" | absolute_url }})I wrote the script for a graphic novel version of "The Great Hunt," a short story originally written for _Dragon Magazine. _The short-lived and ill-fated Worlds of D&D series was published by Devils Due Publishing and edited by James D. Lowder.  Jim was my first editor at TSR.  He helped me wrestle _Elfshadow_ and_ Elfsong_ into shape and edited my first two Forgotten Realms short stories. In the years since then, he has very kindly included me on a variety of projects, from anthologies to essay collections to this--my first (and so far only) foray into writing graphic novel scripts.  Which is, by the way, a lot harder than it looks.
