![Dream Spheres](http://www.elainecunningham.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Dream-Spheres-182x300.jpg)This is the first novel that was actually written for the Songs & Swords series. It's also the last published novel in the series, though I'm certain that Arilyn and Danilo's adventures continue offstage.

In this tale, they learn of a dangerous new trend in the city of Waterdeep, and the price people are willing to pay to live a fleeting, borrowed dream.
