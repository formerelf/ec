![Elfshadow](http://www.elainecunningham.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Elfshadow-174x300.jpg)Initially published in 1991 as a stand-alone novel in the Harpers series, [**_Elfshadow_**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1560761172/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=elainecu-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1560761172&linkId=0dc699fa2391dff68a799a4a0e31efa6) was later reprinted as book 1 of the Songs & Swords series.  These tales follow the adventures of half-elf fighter Arilyn Moonblade, nobleman Danilo Thann, and elven crime lord Elaith Craulnober.

_Elfshadow_ is a mystery in a fantasy setting, my first Forgotten Realms book, and my first published novel. The storytelling process felt very much like a treasure hunt followed by a puzzle quest.  Intriguing bits of lore in Ed Greenwood's campaign setting (affectionately known to gamers as The Old Gray Boxed Set)  fit together to form questions that just _had_ to be explored. For example, the defenses of the elven city Evereska were shored up around the time King Zaor of Evermeet died. Evereska is a very long way from Evermeet, but it seemed to me that there must be a connection.

Turns out I was right about that.

The Harpers, a semi-secret organization of adventurers and bards who strive for to maintain balance and preserve the memory of great deeds, are under attack. Several members have fallen to an assassin, and it does not escape the notice of archmage and Harper leader Khelben Arunsun that Arilyn Moonblade has been nearby when each of these deaths occurred. He sends his nephew, Danilo Thann, to ingratiate himself with Arilyn and determine whether she's a target or a killer.  The search for the Harper Assassin soon entwines with a much older mystery: the nature of the ancient sword Arilyn inherited from her elven mother.
