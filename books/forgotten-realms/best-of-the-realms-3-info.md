Published in 2007, this short story collection includes most of my Forgotten Realms short stories*, as well as a fairly long new tale, "The Knights of Samular," which ties up a few of the loose ends in the novel [_Thornhold_]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link books/forgotten-realms/thornhold-info.md %}). This was the only new story commissioned, but I tossed in a couple of extras. "Answered Prayers" checks in on Liriel and her elven sword-sisters ten years after the events of [_Windwalker_]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link books/forgotten-realms/windwalker-info.md %}). "Tribute" is a very short folktale--the sort of story that might be told to children on a winter night. It's an out-take from the novel [_City of Splendors_]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link books/forgotten-realms/the-city-of-splendors-info.md %}), one of the tales a young nobleman was collecting as a gift for the infant king of Cormyr.  There's also "Elminster's Jest," an expanded version of the ballad Danilo's singing sword belts out in the novel [_Elfsong_]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link books/forgotten-realms/elfsong-info.md %}).

Each story is prefaced by an introduction that tells a bit about the tale.
