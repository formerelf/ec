![Tangled Webs]({{ "/assets/Tangled-Webs-175x300.jpg" | absolute_url }})In the second book of the Starlight & Shadows trilogy, Liriel and Fyodor set sail for Ruathym aboard _The Elfmaid_, a pirate ship owned by one Hrolf the Unruly.  Her enemies follow, joining forces with Ruathym's enemies to become a devastating invasion force. And a certain goddess is intrigued by the drow girl at the center of so much turmoil and chaos.

Liriel is so close to having all she desires:  a father in spirit if not in blood, a companion she can love and trust, a shared quest nearing completion. But Liriel's drow nature is not easily ignored, and neither is the temptation to do anything, even yield herself to an evil goddess, to protect what is hers.

**Cover Art:**

The cover art for the paperback reprints was painted by Todd Lockwood.  To see more of his illustrations, [visit his artist website](http://www.toddlockwood.com/).   [Here's a link](http://www.toddlockwood.com/galleries/books/02/tangled_webs.shtml) to the art page for _Tangled Webs, _which includes a few words from Todd about the symbolism and storytelling in the art. This cover is, hands down, my favorite depiction of Liriel and my favorite Forgotten Realms cover.
