![image-right]({{ "/assets/images/Daughter of the Drow.jpg" | absolute_url}}){: .align-right} The first book in the Starlight & Shadows trilogy introduces Liriel, the daughter of Menzoberranzan's archmage Gromph Baenre. Her immersion into the drow culture of treachery and murder came at the age of five, when Gromph ordered the death of her mother so that he could take possession of the magically-gifted child. Liriel was a surviver, and she did her best to become what was expected of her.  Now the equivalent of a human teenager, she is drow to the core: devious, ambitious, driven. Yet something remains from those years as her mother's adored child--a certain restlessness, a longing for something she can't quite define.

Unlike most noble drow females, Liriel was trained in the arts of magic rather than raised as a future priestess. She had all the advantages her father's wealth and position offered, as well as a rare degree of freedom to pursue her own interests. And the two things Liriel loved most were magic and  exploring. The little-known tunnels of the Underdark, underground lakes filled with voracious fish, the lair of a two-headed deep dragon--no place in the Underdark was too remote or dangerous for the adventurous young girl.  When the Matron Mother of House Baenre decreed that Gromph's daughter must enter Arach Tinilith to train as a priestess of Lolth, Liriel's days of freedom seemed destined to end.

Then a drow merchant with an agenda of his own gives Liriel books about the surface world. She is, as he anticipated, immediately seized by a longing to explore the lands of light.  But at the time, no drow magic could endure the light of the sun. When Liriel finds a way to take her innate drow magic and her wizard's spells to the surface, she slips away from the priestess academy. But many enemies and challengers follow her. Some want to possess her secret, others simply want her dead.  When she makes an alliance with one of her rivals--Fyodor, a young berserker warrior from the land of Rashemen--she begins an adventure far greater than any she'd ever imagined.
