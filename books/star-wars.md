My contribution to the Extended Universe is a minor one: Â the novel [**_Dark Journey_**](https://www.amazon.com/Dark-Journey-Star-Wars-Order/dp/0345428692/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=elainecu-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=f1caae91de08e8640d067a56dbf84a4a&creativeASIN=0345428692), which was the 10th book in the 21-book "New Jedi Order" story arc; and three short stories published in _Star Wars Gamer_ magazine.
