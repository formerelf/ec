---

Undercover vice cop Gwen Gelman left the force under a cloud of suspicion after a bust went wrong.  Now working on her own, she pieces together a living doing small jobs few detectives would consider worth doing. When a wealthy family hires her to find their missing daughter, Gwen stumbles into an older, more personal mystery.  An orphan raised in the system, Gwen learns that everything she knew about her family was a lie. Her too-young appearance and the strange flashes of insight that have plagued her since childhood take on new significance when she  learns that elves are living hidden lives in the prosaic city of Providence, Rhode Island.  Far from the shining beings of Tolkien's Middle Earth, these are creatures from folklore and nightmares. They're determined to reclaim lost power--and Gwen, as well.
