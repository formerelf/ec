Weekdays are for novel-length fiction. Evenings and weekends are for short stuff. Here's what's cooking in the short fiction department.

"Mother, Daughter, Holy Geist," a short story for the _Foreshadows: Ghost of Zero _web fiction, is finished. There may be some small revisions to coordinate the fiction with the accompanying music, an original piece based on music by St. Hildegard, a 12th century mystic, musician, and polymath.

"A Single Thread" is set in Kingdoms of Legend, a Pathfinder-compatible game setting based on Europe in 1415. It's finished, revised, and awaiting publication.

"Fairy Tales" is another story for a shared-world setting. It's for an anthology that explores various aspect of fey/fairy lore.

Tw0 short stories inspired by the Cthulhu mythos. One will be for the print anthology _Madness on the Orient Express, _ due December 1.  The second short story is for a project that has not yet been announced, and no due date has been set.

A story for a themed fantasy anthology.  It's an invitation-only anthology and it hasn't been announced, so I can't  give details. Submission period is December 1-30.

"The Necromancer," a short story that's essentially a rematch between the two young wizards who faced off in "The Illusionist," has not been scheduled or contracted, but I've got a go-ahead of the informal "write it and send it in" variety .  The story will be very short--only about 2500 words--written as a single-episode piece of web fiction.

So.  That's my short fiction schedule for 2012 and early 2013.  I'll post an update on novella/novel publications soon.
