![]({{ "/assets/The-Magehound-178x300.jpg" | absolute_url }})Another of my Forgotten Realms books has been released as an audio book.  **[Here's a link](http://www.audible.com/pd/ref=sr_1_6?asin=B00BTOJCCS&qid=1364230421&sr=1-6)** to its page on Audible.com.

**_[The Magehound](http://www.elainecunningham.com/books/forgotten-realms/the-magehound-info/)_** is the first book in the Counselors & Kings trilogy, set in the magic-rich southern land of Halruaa.  This trilogy gives Forgotten Realms fans a rare and, sadly, last look at this fascinating realm, for most of Halruaa was destroyed by the Spellplague.  And by "destroyed" I mean _gone_.  Instead of land, there's sea and swamp.

But!  With the D&D Fifth Edition coming up, the Forgotten Realms will be returning to a more recognizable form.  I will be very interested to see what this means for Halruaa.

In the meanwhile, there's  **_[The Magehound](http://www.elainecunningham.com/books/forgotten-realms/the-magehound-info/)_**, followed by **_[The Floodgate](http://www.elainecunningham.com/books/forgotten-realms/the-floodgate-info/)_** and **_[The Wizardwar.](http://www.elainecunningham.com/books/forgotten-realms/the-wizardwar-info/) _**

Clicking on any of the book links will take you to the info page for that book, where you'll find a brief synopsis, as well as links to excerpts, reviews, and online booksellers.
