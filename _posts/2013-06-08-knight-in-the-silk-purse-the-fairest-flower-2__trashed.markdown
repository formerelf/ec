Here's a sketch of Timar Dharn, the protagonist of my story in the upcoming anthologyÂ _**A Knight in the Silk Purse.**_ For some non-spoiler background info on the Timar, [here's a link](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/563681582/a-knight-in-the-silk-purse-tales-of-the-emerald-se/posts/502878) to the daily Kickstarter blog by editor Scott Taylor.

![]({{ "/assets/bloduewedd-2-150x150.jpg" | absolute_url }})The story is rooted in the Mabinogion, a collection of Welsh myths. Anyone who has read the story of Blodeuwedd and pays attention to mythic themes knows that Nothing Good Happens when someone attempts to create the perfect woman.
