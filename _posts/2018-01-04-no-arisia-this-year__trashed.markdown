I've decided against attending Arisia this month. Since it's held in Boston, which is only about an hour and a half away, I'd intended to take the train up on Saturday and come back in the early evening. I was an accepted participant, but most of the events that interested me fell outside of that time frame (and also had a high level of author interest and lots of competition), so I wasn't scheduled for any panels this year. But, live and learn. Next year, it would make sense to stay in Boston for the weekend.

I'm still planning to attend Boskone in February and will be posting my schedule shortly.
