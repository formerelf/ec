<p>The ebook version was out in late October, and now the trade paperback is available through <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Killing-Softly-Digital-Fiction-Anthology/dp/1988863333/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1512671902&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=killing+it+softly+2">Amazon.com</a>. </strong></p>
