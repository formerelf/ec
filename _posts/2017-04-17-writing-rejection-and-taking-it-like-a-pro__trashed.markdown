That's the tagline for author Aeryn Rudel's blog **[Rejectomancy.com](https://rejectomancy.com)**, which is one of the more helpful and inspiring author blogs out there.Â He's extremely forthright about the writing process and the realities of the publishing industry. And one of those realities is rejection. 

Just about everyone gets rejections, and they don't stop once you have a publishing track record.

Take Jane Yolen, for example. She's an incredibly prolific author with over 300 published books. She will frequently post on Facebook about what she wrote and submitted, what was accepted and what wasn't. What strikes me about these posts is her ability to weigh each rejection for what it is, and act accordingly. Sometimes a book or poem just wasn't a good match with a particular publisher, so she'll try again elsewhere. Other times, she comments on plans to improve or rework something. The common element is that with each rejection, she's learning something and moving on. That's a great quality to emulate.

I'm working on that.

Last week, I had two rejections in two days. Neither one came as a surprise. One was a stretch, a market I never would have considered submitting to a year ago. But the story made it into the final round of consideration and the editor asked to see more stories, which is about as good as rejections get. The other was a reprint story which I submitted to a podcast magazine. Podcasts are a mystery to me, but since a lot of fiction is being consumed in audio format, it is past time for me to start learning about this part of the business. I liked this story, but I wasn't sure it would work read aloud. In a way, it was helpful to have this suspicion confirmed. It's a step forward in the process of writing for the ear as well as the mind's eye.

Rejection isn't something most people instinctively embrace, but on the other hand, it isn't a thing to fear and avoid. It's evidence that you're working, stretching, risking. It's an opportunity to learn. It's building necessary traits such as perseverance and flexibility. It takes you a step closer toward the stories you want to write, and getting them out to people who want to read them.
