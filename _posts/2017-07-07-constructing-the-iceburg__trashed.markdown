[![](http://www.elainecunningham.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/iceberg-300x195.jpg)](http://www.elainecunningham.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/iceberg.jpg)Last night, I had a very helpful Skype chat with my son Sean about the outline of my novel-in-progress. He asked a very important question about two of the characters:  "Why are they friends?"




This is one of those tip-of-the-iceburg moments in fiction. When two people from very different backgrounds are close friends who know each other's secrets, the story of how they got to that place is important,_ even if it's not the story currently being told_.  So before I can go much further with the w-i-p, I need to sketch out that prequel story, if only in broad strokes.


I'm a history geek, and I believe in the value of knowing what happened and why. A knowledge of history lends insight and perspective to current culture and events. That's equally true in fiction. Characters don't simply appear on the page in chapter one. They lived full (if fictitious) lives before they got to this point in their stories.  The things they experienced will form the choices they make during the story-in-progress. I was reminded of this again this morning by a Twitter message from a Forgotten Realms reader. She wanted to know why Danilo Thann, in the novel [**_Dream Spheres,_**](http://www.elainecunningham.com/books/forgotten-realms/the-dream-spheres-info/) felt such an immediate connection to Lilly, a tavern wench and his half-sister. This is the sort of question writers need to answer during the writing process. For those who are interested, here's what that process looks like for me.




Family is important to Danilo, in no small part because his own family is so problematic. He's the youngest of several siblings, most of whom are quite a bit older than he is. That's isolating. To compound matters, he spent a large chunk of his childhood away from home for reasons that have not been (and will not be) disclosed. The archmage Khelben Arunsun, his purported uncle, played a big role in his life during this traumatic period. Their relationship, though close, has always been fraught. The frivolous facade Dan adopted as part of his role in the Harpers further distanced him from his business-oriented family. So did his interest in music. Musical study, to their way of thinking, was part of a nobleman's well-rounded education, but there comes a point when a Waterdhavian merchant should pay other people to provide music so he can devote his time to the serious business of commerce and social maneuvering. For these and many other reasons, Dan feels like an outsider in his own family. That's one of the things he shares with Arilyn. They are two socially and emotionally adrift people who found a harbor in each other.

When Danilo learned that he had a half-sister, he felt the personal impact of all those lost years, when he might have had a younger sister to protect and tease and love. But the more powerful emotion was that he was appalled his father could know of this girl's existence for all those years, but never support or even acknowledge her. Waterdeep is a thriving, wealthy city, but the lives of the working poor are as difficult and tenuous as anywhere else in the Realms. A tavern wench works long hours. She's viewed as a commodity and often treated like a whore, and there's  little prospect of a better life.  Dan understands this, and feels responsible--no, he _embraces_ the responsibility--for his newfound sister. The connection he feels with Lilly is immediate, personal, complex, and very powerful _because of who is he, what he has experienced, and what he values. _ The reader might not know all the particulars, and probably shouldn't, but the writer must. Otherwise, the reader is unlikely to feel that a character's choices flow from anything deeper and more profound than plot convenience.




I wish I could say that I've lavished this much thought on all my characters, but the fact is that Dan is one of my favorite fictitious people. He has been with me for over 25 years, and every now and then I still feel his presence, looking over my shoulder and commenting on a turn of phrase, wondering why on earth I sold my lute and never bought another, or critiquing the state of my wine cellar. (A conversation that usually begins with, "Why is it, precisely, that you don't HAVE one?")  I enjoy spending time with him.  What I find very encouraging and more than a little exciting is that I'm getting much the same feeling about my current novel-in-progress, and the new fictitious people whose lives are taking shape, both above and below the waterline.
