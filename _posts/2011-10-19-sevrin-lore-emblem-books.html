Several moments passed in silence as he applied spiceberry red to his sketch of a whale-sized serpent. "That is why so many of our writings take the form of emblem books. The pictures work with the text, sometimes illuminating, sometimes obscuring or even contradicting."<a href="http://www.elainecunningham.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/k_karras_bath.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1234 alignright" title="k_karras_bath" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/k_karras_bath-243x300.jpg" alt="" width="168" height="215" /></a></p>
<p>"And sometimes distracting." Henderkin pointed to a painting of a female figure caught in a moment of transformation, not to mention nudity.</p>
<p>The alchemist smirked and shrugged.  "A man should enjoy his work."</p>
<p><a href="http://www.elainecunningham.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/imagesCA9O7QWH.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1236 alignleft" title="imagesCA9O7QWH" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/imagesCA9O7QWH.jpg" alt="" width="189" height="229" /></a>Henderkin picked up a book and turned several pages filled with strange runes and stranger woodcut art.  "This makes no sense to me."</p>
<p>"And that, my dear brother, is entirely the point. Alchemy is the science of transformation.  It cannot be understood at a glance.  Understanding the true nature of things requires effort and discipline; seeing things as they might become requires far more."</p>
<p>"And what's wrong with the way things are?  The way they always have been?"  Henderkin dropped the book and folded sun-browned arms over his chest. "I'm a fisherman, like our father and his before him.  I notice you're not too grand to eat the herring we catch."</p>
<p>Sorvin glanced at the page he was illuminating, and the pattern of tiny fish half-hidden in the shadow of the great serpent. They swam in a mindless circle, oblivious to both the danger and the possibilities above them.</p>
<p>"Alchemy isn't for everyone," he repeated.</p>
