January was busy but quiet. No publications this month, no events. I spent most of my writing time working on the novel-in-progress, and submitted three stories, two original and one reprint, to various magazine or anthology projects. I received one rejection: a reprint poem submitted to a speculative fiction magazine.

Most of my January reading focused on research for the historical fantasy novel. Two notable exceptions were _Thunderbird,_ the fourth book in_ _Chuck Wendig's Miriam Black series, and _The Fire in Fiction, _an excellent book on the writer's craft by literary agent Donald Maass.

The oft-delayed anthology _Hath No Fury_ has been delayed again, this time to May 1. The new publisher is committed to publishing the book, so I'm pretty confident that it will be out this year.
