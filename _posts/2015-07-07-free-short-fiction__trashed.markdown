Small press publishing companies are popping up all over these days. Once of my recent favorites is Evil Girlfriend Media, which has a beautifully designed website (suitably evil) and a great feature:  They publish free flash fiction several times a month. The entire archive is available on the [**EGM Shorts**](http://www.evilgirlfriendmedia.com/egm-shorts/) page.  If you like very short fiction and are in the mood for a quick story fix, you'll find a rather wide variety of speculative fiction.

"Maintenance" will be online this Thursday, July 9.  It's a story I wrote during my mother's battle with Alzheimer's, and it addresses the complications that come with love, memory, and aging.  Long-time readers will recognize a familiar theme in the story twist.

I'll post a link to the story when it's online.  Hope you enjoy the story!
