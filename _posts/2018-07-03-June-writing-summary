<p><strong>SHORT FICTION:</strong></p> 

<p><strong>New Stories:</strong></p> 
<ul>
<li>“Honest Trade,” short story written in early June and submitted to a themed anthology. Awaiting editor’s response.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>/Acceptances/Rejections:</strong></p> 
<ul>
<li>“Living Memory,” a story written in 2016-2017, was accepted in final version for Tales of Good Dogs, an anthology of stories set in the Pugmire RPG world.</li?

<li>Plot Problems,” a flash fiction piece, previously published online in EGM Shorts and heavily revised, was submitted twice. It got a “near miss but send more!” on the first submission, and was accepted on the second submission for publication in Fantasy for the Throne, a reprint anthology of “single-sitting stories.”</li>

<li>“Family Matters,” a flash fiction story written in 2017 and submitted four times in 2018. Awaiting response on sub #4.</li>

<li>“She Who Is Becoming,” a short story originally published in The Phantom Queen Awakes (Morrigan Press, 2010) was submitted twice. Form letter from a reprint anthology (to which I promptly submitted “Plot Problems,” which they accepted) and a “near miss but send more!” from an ezine.</li>

<li>Dead Men Tell No Tales,” a historical ghost story originally published in Sails & Sorcery (Fantasist Enterprises 2007) and reprinted in Memento Mori (Digital Fiction Publishing 2016) was declined by two reprint anthologies.</li>

<li>Synthetic Sanctity,” a story written several years ago for a shared-world project that didn’t happen. I got the rights back and heavily revised the story to file off the shared-world serial numbers. Submitted three times in 2018. There have been a couple of near misses over its 11-submission history, but this story is Very Odd. Debating whether to add it to the Patreon story file or toss it in a trunk.</li> 
</ul>

<p><strong>/Acceptances/PATREON</strong></p> 

I have the pages set up and ready to launch. No promo work done yet, and I need to reformat a short story collection that’s offered as a patron reward, but the site itself is ready to go live.
