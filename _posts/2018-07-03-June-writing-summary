Short Fiction details:

New Stories:

•	“Honest Trade,” short story written in early June and submitted to a themed anthology. Awaiting editor’s response.

Submissions/Acceptances/Rejections:

•	“Living Memory,” a story written in 2016-2017, was accepted in final version for Tales of Good Dogs, an anthology of stories set in the Pugmire RPG world.

•	 “Plot Problems,” a flash fiction piece, previously published online in EGM Shorts and heavily revised, was submitted twice. It got a “near miss but send more!” on the first submission, and was accepted on the second submission for publication in Fantasy for the Throne, a reprint anthology of “single-sitting stories.” 

•	“Family Matters,” a flash fiction story written in 2017 and submitted four times in 2018. Awaiting response on sub #4. 

•	“She Who Is Becoming,” a short story originally published in The Phantom Queen Awakes (Morrigan Press, 2010) was submitted twice. Form letter from a reprint anthology (to which I promptly submitted “Plot Problems,” which they accepted) and a “near miss but send more!” from an ezine.

•	“Dead Men Tell No Tales,” a historical ghost story originally published in Sails & Sorcery (Fantasist Enterprises 2007) and reprinted in Memento Mori (Digital Fiction Publishing 2016) was declined by two reprint anthologies. 

•	“Synthetic Sanctity,” a story written several years ago for a shared-world project that didn’t happen. I got the rights back and heavily revised the story to file off the shared-world serial numbers. Submitted three times in 2018. There have been a couple of near misses over its 11-submission history, but this story is Very Odd. Debating whether to add it to the Patreon story file or toss it in a trunk. 

Stories in the publication pipeline:
•	“The White Tunic,” reprinted in Digital Fantasy Fiction Anthology, June.
•	“Burning,” published in Hath No Fury (Oakland Entertainment), July.
•	“Plot Problems,” reprinted in Fantasy for the Throne, an anthology of “single-sitting stories,” September.
•	“Living Memory,” to be published in Tales of Good Dogs (Onyx Path Press) More info on publication date coming soon. 

Patreon

I have the pages set up and ready to launch. No promo work done yet, and I need to reformat a short story collection that’s offered as a patron reward, but the site itself is ready to go live.
