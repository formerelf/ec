**![]({{ "/assets/pollen.jpg" | absolute_url }})[Here's a link to a blog post on GIGID,](http://ow.ly/CawG30b14jM)** but I also want to provide some background info here, as this is one of those rare times when I feel that I have something truly useful to say.

I've probably had seasonal allergies all my life. When I was a kid, we called them "spring colds," and a lot of them probably did segue into viral infections. As an adult, I had a few years that were pretty much end-to-end respiratory issues. Sinus infections were frequent, asthma episodes were scary, bronchitis was a twice-yearly event, and I've been diagnosed with pneumonia at least five times. Many of these episodes were triggered by seasonal allergies.

Three years ago, we started a serious exploration of habits--how they're formed, how they change, why they matter. My primary focus was getting healthy, and to that end I've been working on building a **habit system**--a group of habits that work together to achieve goals. Allergies are a type of inflammation, and I found that when you address other sources of inflammation, these pollen-intensive days are less likely to put you over the top.

I can't claim to be completely allergy-free, but other than a mild cold this winter, I haven't had a respiratory infection in over three years. The only asthma attack I had during this time was during a choir rehearsal, courtesy of an alto who was drenched in fragrant-yet-toxic chemicals. And last year, I got through both spring and fall allergy seasons just fine without any allergy medication. An occasional sneeze, eyes a little itchy at times, but that's it.

I'm still amazed at the difference a few small habits can make. If an occasional doubt arises, it disappears when I backslide a bit and feel the impact of that behavior. So now that the spring allergy season is in full swing, I'm doubling down on the habits that got me this far. A few of them are listed in the linked blog article.

And now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to stock up on green tea...
