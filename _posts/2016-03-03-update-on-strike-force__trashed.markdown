The Kickstarter for the updated release of Aaron Allston's STRIKE FORCE was successful, and a couple of the stretch goals have been met. The RPG will be released with full-color art and in hardcover format. Congratulations to the creative team!

However.

The next stretch goal, which would have been the anthology of short fiction, was not met. So it appears that there will be noÂ superhero storytelling--at least, not at this point.
