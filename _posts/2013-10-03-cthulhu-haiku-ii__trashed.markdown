![]({{ "/assets/Cthulhu-Haiju-II-cover.jpg" | absolute_url }})For the last several years, **[ Popcorn Press](http://www.popcornpress.com) **has been releasing a collection of poetry around Halloween.  In addition to a _Halloween Haiku_ anthology, editor Lester Smith has focused on vampires, zombies, and the Cthulhu Mythos.  This year's theme is a return to Lovecraft-inspired haiku and short fiction.

I was very pleased to learn that three of my poems will be included in this volume.

Submissions are still being accepted. For more info, please **[follow this link](http://www.CthulhuHaiku2.com/). **
