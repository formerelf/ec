[![](http://www.elainecunningham.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Dragon-Dictation.jpg)](http://www.elainecunningham.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Dragon-Dictation.jpg)Today I tried something new: Dictating scenes from my work-in-progress into [**Dragon Dictation**](https://www.nuance.com/mobile/mobile-applications/dragon-dictation.html), a free iPhone app,  while walking on the bike path.

This morning I walked 4 miles in a little over an hour, and when I came home and downloaded the transcriptions, I was stunned by the total: **2813 words.**

Sure, it's the roughest form of Draft Zero, but it's a lot of raw material and more than I usually write in an entire day. Also, I find that the headspace inhabited when walking is different from that I experience at the keyboard. I've often observed that I "think with my fingers," and there's nothing wrong with that, but this morning I felt as if I was thinking on a different, less granular level. Not too surprising, I suppose. Why wouldn't what your body is doing have an impact on how and what your brain processes?

I'll be interested to see how this experiment goes. If it continues to yield productive session, I'm going to be getting a lot more exercise.
