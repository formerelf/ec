###### My primary focus this month was the novel-in-progress, with the goal of finishing Draft Zero by the end of October.  Accordingly, I didn't write any new short fiction in September, and only one short non-fiction piece.





###### **Summary:**




Publications: 1
Submissions: 2
Acceptances: 0
Rejections: 2
Projects currently in circulation: 4


**Publications:**



 	
  * Review of _Anne Boleyn: The King's Obsession_ by Allison Weir was included in Issue #112 of **[_Renaissance Magazine_](http://www.renaissancemagazine.com)**.  This magazine is geared toward RenFaire enthusiasts, as well as people who enjoy popular history and historical novels, games, and music. I've been writing articles and paid book and music reviews for them for several years now.
