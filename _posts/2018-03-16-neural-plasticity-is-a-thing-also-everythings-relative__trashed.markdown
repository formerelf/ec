Years ago, before my kids were born, I started studying the Welsh language. It was a short-lived effort because the reaction of my neural circuitry was, "Nope. This is not like any other language we've seen. It makes no sense. DO NOT WANT. Will not learn!" Thirty-some years later, after a few months of Japanese study and struggling with three syllabary systems, I decided to add Welsh back in. No high goals here--I just want to get enough phonetic knowledge to be able to pronounce proper nouns so I can talk about my novel-in-progress without looking completely ignorant. (For example, I found out from watching a Welsh police procedural series that I was pronouncing Caradoc, the name of a POV character, incorrectly. Not good.)

Well. I took one look at Duolingo's first Welsh lesson and my brain lit up like a hot-pillow motel room under a blacklight. It was all, "YES! We know these symbols! Sure, the pronunciation is a little tricky but we can TOTALLY DO IT! We will swallow this lesson whole and remember every word FOREVER!"

There's a lesson in there somewhere. Maybe two or three of them, including "Don't use hot-pillow-motel analogies unless you want your reader to get stuck in paragraph two."
