April was an odd month. There was a lot of writing going on, but you wouldn't know it from the summary below. A couple of small projects I'd hoped to finish were pushed back into May (or possibly beyond.)  On the bright side, I am very enthusiastic about the new novel, which will be the most ambitious story I've written since **[_Evermeet_](http://www.elainecunningham.com/books/forgotten-realms/evermeet-info/),** and considerably longer. I'm in learning mode, trying new things and submitting to new markets, and that's a very exciting process.

**Publications: 1**



 	
  * _**Renaissance Faire and Culture Magazine,** _Vol. 21 #3, Issue #109. A review of _Edward IV, England's Forgotten Warrior King: His Life, His People, and His Legacy_ by Anthony Corbet.  I was surprised to receive the "scribe's copy" of this issue, as I'd submitted this review about a year ago and by now, I'd assumed it had been declined.


**Submissions: 4**



 	
  * Wrote and submitted two short stories, on spec.

 	
  * Submitted a previously published story to a podcast magazine.

 	
  * Submitted "Synthetic Sanctity" to Market #4. (Persistence!)


**Acceptances: 0**

**Rejections:  2 (or possibly 4)**



 	
  * "Synthetic Sanctity" was declined by Market #4. I got some very good feedback from two Trusted Readers, and am going to do a substantial rewrite before sending it out again.

 	
  * The reprint story I sent to a podcast magazine was declined. This was a first step into audio for me (not counting the audiobook versions publishers have done of my backlist.) I've started listening to podcasts, and I'm going to practice recording my work-in-progress to make sure a story works for the ear. Lots to learn!

 	
  * Not all rejections are definitive. Many publishers don't respond at all unless they accept a story or article, so there comes a point at which writers have to call a submission's "time of death" and turn off the life support. This month I'm pulling the plug on two essays written and submitted back in December. It's always possible to be surprised a few months later, as in the _Renaissance Magazine_ review, but in these two cases, it seems unlikely.


**Work in progress:**



 	
  * First draft of an on-spec fantasy novel.

 	
  * Revising a non-fiction ebook on habit acquisition.

 	
  * Awaiting editors' notes on two short stories submitted in March.


**Projects in circulation: 3**


After wiping the two essays off my submission slate, I have just three short stories out in the world--the two new ones submitted in April, and a story submitted to a reprint anthology.


**Writing related:**



 	
  * Sent the graphic novel version of my Forgotten Realms story "The Great Hunt" to the winner of the March contest held on the Facebook group Forgotten Realms Archives

 	
  * Ran a contest for April in Forgotten Realms Archives with two audiobook versions of _Winter Witch_ as prizes.
