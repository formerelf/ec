The guys at **Move Rate 20 Games** have launched a new **[Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moverate20games/master-of-spies-card-game)** for their card game. I've played this game in a demo. It's easy to learn and the game mechanics are solid. It's a good social game or family game, but it would also be a good filler at a hardcore gaming session. Recommended!
