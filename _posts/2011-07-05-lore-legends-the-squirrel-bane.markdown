Legends of the fey persist in Sevrin, even among those humans who no longer believe in their existance.  One of the most persistent of these folktales deals with Varn, a pixie warrior whose ferocity in battle earned him the title "Squirrel Bane."

Stories about Varn Squirrel Bane are usually told to children and are slightly comic in nature. for most humans find the notion of combat between pixies and squirrel to be amusing, even cute.

Squirrels are voracious feeders who will decimate any food store they find. A pixie's larder is one of their favorite targets.  Pixie abodes, in general, are attractive to squirrels, since these are built into hollows in trees and are usually of a size well suited to squirrel nests.  Although pixies take care to build multi-layered defenses against squirrel invasion, the creatures seem to delight in defeating any such efforts.  Pixie portals are small and stout, but a determined squirrel will gnaw until the opening is large enough to accommodate its bulk.

In addition to battling over food and nesting site, pixies must guard their young against squirrel attacks. Nestling birds and young pixies are not usually a squirrel's preferred food, but it will rob nests if other food is scarce.  An occasional squirrel gets a taste for flesh and becomes a _ravinar.  _Pixies hunt down and kill these predators, just as humans would a man-eating bear.

Robbing a feyflight nest is the only thing that motivates the usually solitary creatures to combine their efforts. These t[](http://www.elainecunningham.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/SquirrelsBadAss.jpg)emporary warbands, known as _ravinari,_ mount attacks notable for persistence and disturbingly cunning strategy. [](http://www.elainecunningham.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/SquirrelsBadAss.jpg)_[](http://www.elainecunningham.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/SquirrelsBadAss.jpg)_

It has inspired many a twilight game between two teams of young warriors, who might spent hours or even days plotting traps and tricks and strategies. Minor injuries are such a common occurrence in these games that a family's store of ungents and bandages is often referred to with amused resignation as the "ravinari box."
