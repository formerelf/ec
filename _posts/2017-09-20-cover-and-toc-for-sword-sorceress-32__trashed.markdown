###### **Coming November 2!**


![]({{ "/assets/ss32.jpg" | absolute_url }})


Eighteen tales of magic and mayhem, in plenty of time for the holidays. If you really want to run with the Formidable Women theme, you could pair this with the **_Hath No Fury_** anthology that's coming out the first of December.


My story, **Royal Daughters**, is a blend of fantasy and historical fiction, set in Scotland's border country during the infancy of Mary Queen of Scots.
