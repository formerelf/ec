![Cover, Heroes of Thornwall]({{ "/assets/Cover-Heroes-of-Thornwall.jpg" | absolute_url }})Happy Book Birthday to Marc Tassin and the [**_Heroes of Thornwall_**](http://drivethrurpg.com/product/145499/Heroes-of-Thornwall)!

This is his first adventure set in Aetaltis, a Pathfinder-compatible RPG setting. It's classic sword and sorcery, done very well.

[Here's a press release ](http://aetaltis.com/node/57)with more info.



This is a beautiful book. The art is striking, and fantasy cartography doesn't get much better than this:

**And fiction is not far behind!**

On May 11th, Marc is launching a Kickstarter to fund an anthology of tales set in Aetaltis.  If you've read shared-world fantasy, you've probably heard of some of the contributors:  Richard Lee Byers, Larry Correia, Erin Evans, David Farland, Ed Greenwood, Dave Gross, John Helfers, Steve Long, Mel Odom, Jean Rabe, Cat Rambo, Aaron Rosenberg, Lucy Snyder, Beth Vaughan, and Bill Willingham.
