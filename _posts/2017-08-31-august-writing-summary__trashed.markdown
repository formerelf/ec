This month was mostly about the novel-in-progress. The highlight, however, was attending Gen Con for the first time in a decade. I met lots of interesting people, touched base with friends old and new, signed some books, played some games, and talked about various Secret Projects.

**August summary:**


Publications: 1
Submissions: 2
Acceptances: 2
Rejections: 1
Projects currently in circulation: 3





##### **Work in progress:**





 	
  * Writing Draft Zero of a historical fantasy novel

 	
  * A Mythos-themed novella, still in brainstorming stage

 	
  * Awaiting editor’s notes for a short story solicited for a shared-world anthology


**Publications:**



 	
  * _**Winterhexe**_, a German translation of the Pathfinder Tales novel [**_Winter Witch_**](http://www.elainecunningham.com/books/pathfinder-tales/winter-witch-info/), was published by Feder & Schwert.


**Submissions: **



 	
  * "Family Matters," a new flash fiction story, submitted to a webzine

 	
  * "The White Tunic," a story published in 2013, submitted to a reprint anthology


**Acceptances: 2**



 	
  * "The White Tunic" was accepted for publication in a fantasy reprint anthology by Digital Fantasy Press. I'd submitted it last month to their horror anthology; this, apparently, was a better fit.

 	
  * A review of _A King's Obsession, _a historical novel by Allison Weir, was accepted and scheduled for publication in _Renaissance Magazine,_ issue #112


**Rejections: 1**



 	
  * "Dead Men Tell No Tales" did not make the final cut for a ghosts & pirates reprint anthology.


**Completed in August:**



 	
  * Wrote and submitted "Family Matters," a flash fiction story (800 words)

 	
  * Wrote "Turning Characters into People," an article about the writing process, to be published on my Patreon.

 	
  * Wrote 7 blog posts for this website, including two longer articles on the topic "Setting as Character."
