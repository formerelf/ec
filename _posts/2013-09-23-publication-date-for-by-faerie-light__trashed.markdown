![]({{ "/assets/By-Faerie-Light-cover.png" | absolute_url }})Editor Scott Galen is wrapping up the final details on this anthology, which is scheduled forÂ **November 1** release. Please keep in mind that the veils between the worlds are thin around Samhain and take sensible precautions, such as sprinkling a circle of salt around your reading chair or having a bit of cold iron handy.

As a contributor to this anthology, I hereby disclaim any and all responsibility for mischief done and curses laid by any fey who may regard the reading of these tales as an invitation.

But if they _do_ show up, take pictures.
