A lot of items on my bucket list get put there after the fact. I'll do something interesting and think, "Hmm... That really should have been on the list." This weekend, I'll be participating in my first commercial recording with the Providence Singers and a professional chamber orchestra.

There's a dress rehearsal with orchestra tonight, and all day Sunday we'll be recording in Mechanics Hall in Worcester. The acoustics there are excellent; to give some perspective, last weekend YoYo Ma was recording there.

Looking forward to it!
