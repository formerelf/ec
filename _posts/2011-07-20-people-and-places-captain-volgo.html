<p>Captain of the adept Rhendish's personal guard, Volgo epitomizes the northland warrior:  tall, blond, bearded, and massively built.  He is a powerful fighter and has the reputation of being a capable commander.</p>
<p>What fewer people know, however, is that Volgo started his career as a Gatherer, a mercenary who hunts rare animals and members of the old races.  In his youth, he gained fame for killing a young forest dragon.  Before he came to work exclusively for Rhendish, his skills as a hunter were much sought-after.  His personal trophy collection is vast, varied, and more than a little macabre.</p>
<p>A few people wonder what purpose Rhendish might have in employing such a man.  Of course, such speculations are voiced softly, and always behind closed doors.</p>
