<h5><strong>Myths and Legends in Urban Fantasy</strong></h5>
<p>17 Feb 2018, Saturday 14:00 - 15:00, Marina 4 (Westin)</p>
<p>Urban fantasy may focus on stories set within cities, but many of these tales come with some sort of mythology or legend at their core. What is it about the mix of ancient mythology and modern city that we find so interesting? How do we blend stories from our rural past into a contemporary cityscape without creating a hot mess?</p>

<h5><strong>Open Mic: Myths &amp; Legends</strong>!</h5>
<p>17 Feb 2018, Saturday 20:00 - 21:00, Galleria - Stage (Westin)</p>
<p>Live from Boskone: A special selection of tall tales as told by our program participants — plus audience members. All show off their open mic skills in the third annual Boskone Open Mic extravaganza. This year features the myths and legends of yesterday, today, and tomorrow! Each participant contributes his/her most legendary performance — a 5-minute story, poem, song, skit, interpretive dance, or whatever!</p>
<p><i>OPTIONAL: For extra appeal, feel free to come </i>dressed<em> as your favorite mythic or legendary character.<br />
<u><br />
The Rules</u>: Boskone members are invited to join our participants in the open mic by signing up for one of the six open slots at the door to the event, which opens for sign-ups at 7:30 p.m. Each performer is given a firm 5-minute time limit (max), including setup time. So a quick transition between acts is key. Please no profanity: Dragonslair is within hearing distance.</em></p>

<h5><strong>Writing Stories for Themed Anthologies</strong></h5>
<p>18 Feb 2018, Sunday 12:00 - 13:00, Harbor III (Westin)</p>
<p>Themed anthologies have grown in popularity, creating a new life for short fiction. However, editing and writing for a themed anthology isn't as easy as it sounds. How do you find stories? To what extent do you edit stories? We'll even ask the audience for their input on anthology ideas!</p>
