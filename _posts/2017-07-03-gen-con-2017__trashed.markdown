I wasn't planning to attend Gen Con this summer, but just this week the stars aligned and plans fell into place. I'll be there from Wednesday afternoon through Saturday (leaving very early Sunday morning), and will be participating in the Writers' Symposium. Â Schedule of events coming soon.i

Hope to see many of you there!
