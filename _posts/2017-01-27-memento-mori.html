<p><em><a href="{{ '/assets/images/Memento-Mori-front-cover.jpg' | absolute_url }}"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3760" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Memento-Mori-front-cover.jpg" alt="" width="332" height="500" /></a><strong>Memento Mori</strong> </em> is Latin for "Remember that you too must die." This cheerful reminder kicks off a collection of dark fantasy and horror tales with death as the central theme. My contribution is "Dead Men Tell No Tales," a ghost story set in colonial Newport, Rhode Island.  It was originally published in <em>Sails &amp; Sorcery,</em> an anthology of sea-themed tales by Fantasist Enterprises. The narrator is a pirate of limited intellect, a powerful fighter who perceives far more than he understands. It's one of my favorite stories.  If you haven't read it--and if this collection sounds like something you might enjoy--now's the time to pick it up. For the next several days, the ebook will be on sale for $.99 on Amazon.com.  <a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51aBb6Msc3L.jpg"><strong>Here's a link</strong></a> to the book's page.</p>
