As a child, I read incessantly. One of the series that caught my imagination featured "the Littles," a family of tiny humans who lived in the walls of a typical family house. Their size created significant challenges, as well as a new and intriguing way to view the world.

![]({{ "/assets/By-Faerie-Light-cover.jpg" | absolute_url }})This notion has stuck with me over the years, and it's the basis for "The White Tunic," a story in this anthology. A young farmer strikes a bargain with a tiny fey warrior, who promptly takes him up on it. Before you know it, he has been seriously downsized.

[**In this review,**](https://nerdsonearth.com/2017/04/faerie-light-short-stories-big-content/) the writer suggests using this notion in RPG campaigns. Since many of the people who read my stories are also gamers, this was something I had in mind while writing. Â Shrinking your player characters would give them an interesting way to experience the world and their place in it.

Another idea, and something I do frequently when I'm out hiking, is to envision yourself the size of a bird or chipmunk and imagine what the world would look like from that perspective. This draws your focus to the environment in a way that you generally don't experience when you're moving through it as a human. The forest floor becomes more detailed and nuanced and important, the canopy both closer and more vast.

I'm fond of "The White Tunic," mostly because it so clearly defines one of my primary storytelling values: Stories are all about possibilities, experiences, and seeing life--and perhaps yourself--a little differently than you did before.
