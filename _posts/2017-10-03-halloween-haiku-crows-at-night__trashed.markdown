Here's today's bit of seasonal micro-poetry. Â As fellow corvid afficianados are likely to know, this haiku states fact: crows and ravens don't fly at night. As twilight approaches, they return to their roost and stay until early morning. So if you DO see a crow-like creature out and about at night, you might want to reach for that bottle of holy water in your pocket.
