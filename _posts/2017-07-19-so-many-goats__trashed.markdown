If you're going to **Gen Con** and you're interested in donating to a great cause, consider the **Worldbuilder's Party**, an afternoon of gaming and goats. Lots of goats! Every ticket purchased will provide a goat for an impoverished family, via the wonderful Heifer International organization.

I'll be tag-teaming with Brad Beaulieu to run the board game "Lords of Waterdeep." He'll be running games from 1-3:45 and I'll be stepping in from 3:45 to 5:00. (Note: Since I'm a late addition to GenCon, I'm not listed among the participants.)
