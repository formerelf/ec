<p>The German translation of <a href="http://www.elainecunningham.com/books/pathfinder-tales/winter-witch-info/"><em><strong>Winter Witch</strong></em></a> will be released next week by publisher Feder &amp; Schwert. They'll have a page up late next week; I'll provide a link when it's available.</p>
<p>This might sounds like a dubious use of promotional energy, as most people who read this post probably won't read or speak German, but you never know.</p>
<p>For example, I grew up hearing German spoken. Kinda sorta. My grandmother was Polish, and she often mixed up English and German words because hey--close enough. I just absorbed the meanings, as kids do, and not until I started taking German classes on a college level did I realize that I already knew a few bits and pieces.  A few years later, I took a class in German/English translation. And since I wasn't the only person in any of those classes, I'm aware that not every American is monolingual as a matter of principle.</p>
<p>If German is not your thing, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pathfinder-Tales-Winter-Elaine-Cunningham/dp/1601252862/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1503424815&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=Winter+Witch"><strong><em>Winter Witch</em></strong></a> can be found on Amazon.com in French translation: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pathfinder-Tome-2-French-Edition/dp/2363280644/ref=la_B00458D7YO_1_65?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1503424784&amp;sr=1-65&amp;refinements=p_82%3AB00458D7YO"><em><strong>La Sorciere de L'Hiver</strong></em></a>.</p>
