![]({{ "/assets/Tales-of-the-Emerald-Serpent-209x300.jpg" | absolute_url }})A while back, I saw this gorgeous cover by [Todd Lockwood](http://www.toddlockwood.com/) and was immediately filled with Anthology Envy.  You know what I'm talking about--that moment when you see or hear of a nifty short fiction project and think, "Crap! Wish I could've been part of that."

Well, it turns out that I can.  Editor Scott Taylor is following up with a second anthology in the same setting, and I was invited to play.

_[Tales of the Emerald Serpent](http://www.amazon.com/Tales-Emerald-Serpent-Ghosts-ebook/dp/B008C6JE2Y/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1370441809&sr=1-1&keywords=tales+of+the+emerald+serpent)_ is notable for several things.  First, it's Todd Lockwood's fiction debut, and I was not surprised to learn that this wonderful visual storyteller can also paint a darn good tale with words. Second, it's old-school fantasy inspired by Thieves World. Third, while each story stands alone, they're all connected.  And finally, lots of good people are playing in the particular sandbox.  Many of the original authors are returning for the second volume, **_A Knight in the Silk Purse,_** which focuses on a murder investigation in the infamous Black Gate district. If you've read and enjoyed _Tales of the Emerald Serpent_, you'll be pleased to see the return of several characters.
