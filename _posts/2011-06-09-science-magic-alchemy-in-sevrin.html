<p>Alchemy has been practiced in the Known Lands for hundred of years, but knowledge of this tradition <span>reached <span>Sevrin</span> about fifty years ago.  In its infancy, <span>Sevrin</span> alchemy was a central part of the plan to overthrow </span><span><span>Eldreath</span>, the sorcerer lord.  </span><span>This early focus determined the course of <span>Sevrin's</span> approach to alchemy. </span></p>
<p>In the southern lands where it originated, alchemy is as a philosophy and spiritual tradition in addition to being a practical art.  Personal transformation is considered to be the goal of wise men, and the notion of "changing base metals into gold" is a metaphor, not a literal quest.</p>
<p><span>In <span>Sevrin</span>, however, </span>the<span> search for <span>alkahest</span>, a universal solvent, became a search for alchemical weapons that could melt metal armor, burn with unquenchable flame, or </span><span>cause noxious fumes that could stun or kill.  Such weapons won <span>Sevrin's</span> freedom from <span>Eldreath</span> and discourage other countries from attacking, but the price has been high.  </span></p>
<p><span><span>Corin</span>, a small island at the northern end of the chain of islands that make up <span>Sevrin</span>, is a casualty of those early experiments. Once a thriving community of fishing villages, small farms, and busy market town, it is all but deserted.  Most people of <span>Sevrin</span> believe that <span>Corin</span> was destroyed by <span>Eldreath's</span> sorcery. </span></p>
<p>Since the overthrow of Eldreath, Sevrin alchemy has diversified.  Some adepts still focus on weapons, others lead the search for medicines that will cure ills and prolong life. Others focus on metals and craftsmanship, building clockwork machines <span>that have become <span>Sevrin's</span> most profitable export.  These machines range from toys to <span>safeboxes</span>,  from devious</span> traps to musical instruments, from  animated statues to small hand weapons.  <span>Two adepts, <span>Rhendish</span> and <span>Muldonny</span>, are famo</span>us for their clockwork guards.  They jealously guard the secrets to these creations, however, and keep these metal servants strictly for their own use.</p>
