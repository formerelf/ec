![halloweenhaiku2test5f-661x1024](http://www.elainecunningham.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/halloweenhaiku2test5f-661x1024-194x300.jpg)As it has every year since 2009, **[Popcorn Press](http://www.popcornpress.com)** will be publishing a collection that's mostly seasonal poetry, with a bit of short fiction tossed into the mix.

This will be my third appearance in PP's Halloween collections. Â My contributions include a short free verse poem, two haiku, and the foreword. Editor Lester Smith brings his usual seamless professionalism and joyful sense of play to this project. If all collections were this much fun, everyone would be reading and writing poetry.

As it should be.
