The first superhero RPG, Aaron Allston's STRIKE FORCE, is being rebooted for the 21st century. Here's the pitch for the Kickstarter, which launched today and is _already_ about half funded.

One of the stretch goals is an anthology of short fiction. I'm delighted by the prospect of participating in this tribute to Aaron and the contribution he made to the fantasy genre.
