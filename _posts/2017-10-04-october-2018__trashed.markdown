  * On October 1, e-publish _Payback's a Witch_, a very quirky urban fantasy novel that's been on my to-do list for years.

 	
  * On October 10, start publishing _Hex and Violins_, a sequel to the above novel, as serial novella on Patreon, one chapter every day, with the conclusion on Halloween.

 	
  * Write at least one new short story for a seasonal anthology.

 	
  * Finish writing a ballad I started a few years back entitled "Tastefully Matted and Framed."

 	
  * Participate in Inktober and draw one sketch every day. 

 	
  * Fall foliage hikes: Franconia Notch in New Hampshire's White Mountains and Mt. Greylock in western Massachusetts.

 	
  * Have photo taken in a black gown and my Victorian witch hat, use it as my author photo for the month.

 	
  * Spend Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts.

 	
  * Go to Hammond Castle in Gloucester, Massachusetts for one of their Haunted Halloween nights.

 	
  * Go to the Jack o'Lantern Spectacular at Roger Williams Zoo.

 	
  * Make pumpkin whoopie pies filled with cream cheese icing.

 	
  * Host a game night/pumpkin ale tasting
