_![]({{ "/assets/Memento-Mori-front-cover.jpg" | absolute_url }})**Memento Mori** _ is Latin for "Remember that you too must die." This cheerful reminder kicks off a collection of dark fantasy and horror tales with death as the central theme. My contribution is "Dead Men Tell No Tales," a ghost story set in colonial Newport, Rhode Island.  It was originally published in _Sails & Sorcery,_ an anthology of sea-themed tales by Fantasist Enterprises. The narrator is a pirate of limited intellect, a powerful fighter who perceives far more than he understands. It's one of my favorite stories.  If you haven't read it--and if this collection sounds like something you might enjoy--now's the time to pick it up. For the next several days, the ebook will be on sale for $.99 on Amazon.com.  [**Here's a link**](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51aBb6Msc3L.jpg) to the book's page.
