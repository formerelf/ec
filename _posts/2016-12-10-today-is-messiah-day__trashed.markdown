[**This is what I'm doing today.**](http://www.providencejournal.com/entertainmentlife/20161207/providence-singers-strives-for-fresh-messiah)  Singers report to the Veterans Memorial Auditorium in Providence at 1:30 for a full rehearsal, followed by a supper break and a 7:00 performance.  It's a privilege to sing with this choir and this conductor, and pure joy to be onstage with a chamber orchestra and harpsichord.
