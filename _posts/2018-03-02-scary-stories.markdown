The next anthology sponsored by the HWA (Horror Writers of America) will be a tribute to the "Scary Stories" books, which were collections of old tales and urban legends retold by Alvin Schwartz for the middle reader.












Kids love spooky stories. The impulse to test ourselves against the terrors of the night is older than human history, and it starts at an early age.Â I bought these anthologies for my sons when they were in grade school. Many of the stories were variations of tales I read, heard, and told as a kid. So that's two generations of good memories, courtesy of the HWA.











The submission period opened yesterday and will close on May 1, and _it's only open to HWA members._ If you've been considering joining this excellent organization but needed a little extra boost to break free of inertia, this should do it.
