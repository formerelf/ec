 +<p>During April and May, most of my focus was on the novel-in-progress. I only sent out two short story submissions and heard back from several markets to which I'd submitted earlier this year. At this time, I only have one story out in the world seeking its fortune, and four stories that have been accepted and are in the publishing pipeline. I also committed to writing two new stories for themed anthologies, both of which will be published later this year.</p>

 +<p><strong>Upcoming releases:</strong></p>
 +<ul>
 +<li> June: "The White Tunic" will be published in the reprint anthology <i>Digital Fantasy Fiction</i>, which has been rescheduled several times and will (probably) be published in June.</li>
 +<li> July: "Burning" will be published in the anthology <i>Hath No Fury.</i> This is another project that has been repeatedly rescheduled. It has been printed, though, and it looks as if the July delivery date will actually happen.</li>
 +<li> September: "Plot Problems" will be published in the reprint anthology <i>Fantasy for the Throne: Single-sitting Reads</i></li>
 +</ul>
