![]({{ "/assets/The-Rules-of-Magic.jpg" | absolute_url }})This was a filling-the-well sort of weekend. Friday evening at the RI Philharmonic, listening to my favorite Mozart piano concerto and the Saint-Saëns organ symphony. Saturday at the RI Festival of Children's Books during the day and playing games (Roll for the Galaxy, Cacao, and The Dresden Files cooperative card game) at [**Rivendell Books and Games**](http://rivendellbooksandgames.com) in the evening. Sunday was for walking, our weekly everyone-in-the-kitchen family lunch, and tending to necessary weekly routines. 




Over the weekend I also read **_[The Rules of Magic](https://www.amazon.com/Rules-Magic-Novel-Alice-Hoffman/dp/1501137476/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1508159960&sr=8-1&keywords=The+Rules+of+Magic),_** Alice Hoffman's new book. It's a prequel to her bestselling book, _Practical Magic_, and it's wonderful. Reading a book like that is like listening to Renee Fleming sing: it shows you how much room you have to grow. That can be discouraging, but it can also leave you feeling energized by the possibilities ahead. Today, I choose the latter response.
