It will probably come as no surprise to anyone that the northland dwarves were fond of hoarding.  In addition to the usual stockpiles of weapons and a lavish treasury, they collected knowledge.

The library known as Cragslore was one of the finest repositories of knowledge any civilization could claim.  A thriving community grew around this library, and dwarves came from all the known lands to study lore that could be found in no other place.  During Cragslore's glory days, dwarven adventurers quested for rare volumes nearly as often as they sought magical items and treasure hoards.

The greatest wonder of Cragslore was the runewalls--long, smooth expanses of stone arranged to form a circular maze.  Both sides of this maze were inscribed with the history, lore, arts and science of the Carmot dwaves.  _Walking the Runewall _required years of study, the equivalent of attending a human university.

No human or elf has ever walked the runewall.  In fact, the very existance of Craglore is one of the dwarves' most carefully guarded secrets.  Only a few elves have heard the tale, and they have nearly as much reason as dwarves to keep the knowledge housed in the library out of human hands.  No human knows that Craglore's secrets lie beneath the island of Sevrin.

The destruction of Craglore unleashed wards designed to protect the library even in death.  In the centuries since Craglore's fall, a few dwaven adventurers have tried to excavate the site.  None returned.  The restoration of Cragslore is widely considered an impossible task, to the extent that "digging for Cragslore" has become a dwarven proverb for futility.
