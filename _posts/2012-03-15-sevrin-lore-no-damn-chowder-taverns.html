<p><a href="http://www.elainecunningham.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/No-Damn-Chowder.jpg"><img class="alignright" title="http://www.dreamstime.com/-image13469261" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/No-Damn-Chowder.jpg" alt="" width="303" height="280" /></a>Sevrin is composed of seven main islands and many smaller <a href="http://www.elainecunningham.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/No-Damn-Chowder.jpg"></a>islets. Predictably, fishing is a common occupation and an vital part of the economy. But as important as fish is to the Sevrin diet, there are nights when fisherfolk would rather kiss a selkie than face another fish. And so when a tavern in the fishing village of Whalespout renamed itself No Damn Chowder and altered its menu accordingly, it became an instant success.</p>
<p>Before long, No Damn Chowder signs were common sights along docks and in seaside villages. Typical fare includes spit-roasted fowl and stewed rabbit pies, goat or mutton, and small loaves of bread served warm with a wedge of cheese and small bowls of meat drippings for dipping. No fish is served. Ever.</p>
<p>Everyone knows about the  storyspinner who was tossed through a window for singing a sea chanty at a No Damn Chowder tavern, though no one can agree on exactly where that happened.</p>
