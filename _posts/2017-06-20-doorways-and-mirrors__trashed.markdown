[![](http://www.elainecunningham.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Hath-No-Fury.jpg)](http://www.elainecunningham.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Hath-No-Fury.jpg)This anthology is coming together and is scheduled for an August release, but that's not the subject of this post. It's about a moment of pure joy that reminded me why I read and tell stories.

**_Hath No Fury_** was funded through a Kickstarter campaign. The editors encouraged the authors to offer rewards for higher levels of patronage, including Tuckerization, which allows a supporter to name a character after himself  or someone he knows. I've never encountered this practice before, and I had a hard time envisioning why anyone would plunk down $150 to name a character, but hey--why not. It's important to be a team player. To my astonishment, someone bought the Tuckerization. When I learned who it was for, the motivation made perfect sense. The parents of an avid reader, a "dragon crazy" girl who just turned 13, are giving her a fictitious namesake.

This makes me ridiculously happy.

This dragon-crazy young girl will share a name with a dragon commander, a woman who possesses not only psychic power, but personal courage and a character arc that shows she can learn and grow.

I repeat: So ridiculously HAPPY!

It probably wouldn't have hit me so strongly before the Wonder Woman movie. Viewer reaction to this movie demonstrates how much representation _matters._ A female superhero. A Jewish Wonder Woman. A few words spoken in the Blackfoot language. And from where I sit, a couple of badass fifty-something women doing just fine on the battlefield, thank you very much. Stories are doorways, but they are also mirrors. That moment of recognition can be very powerful.

When I started writing the story for this anthology, my goal was to tell an entertaining tale about a woman facing enormous challenges and temptations.  Social commentary or GO GIRL! cheerleading wasn't part of the plan. But the thought that this story might mean something special, if only to one dragon-crazy girl, made me very happy.

Ridiculously so.
