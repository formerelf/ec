Samhain--Halloween, in its current incarnation--was regarded by some people as the end of the old year. I like the idea of choosing costumes that represent what you'd like to change and how you'd like to grow in the coming year.




It's also a good time to take stock of the things that are hindering you from becoming the person you'd like to be. Â Could be friends or family, but more likely, it's a script--a belief or pattern of thought--that has been playing in your head for as long as you can remember.
