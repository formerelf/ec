One of the new habits I'm working to establish is spending some time on the last day of the month to evaluate that month's progress and to plan for the month ahead. For those who might be interested, here's a summary of what happened in March.

**Publications:  1**



 	
  * "Lorelei," a previously published short story, was released in March as part of the Digital Fantasy Short Fiction line.


**Projects completed: 3**



 	
  * Two short stories that were solicited for themed anthologies.

 	
  * The first draft of a non-fiction ebook I'm writing on spec.


**Submissions:  3**



 	
  * The two themed anthology short stories mentioned above

 	
  * "Synthetic Sanctity," an odd little tale I wrote a couple of years back, went to market #3. (Persistence!)


**Accepted: 1**



 	
  * Heard back from the editor of one of the solicited stories via a form letter that said all the submitted stories were strong and none needed rewrites, only revisions. Close enough. So, yay!


**Rejections:  1**



 	
  * "Synthetic Sanctity" made it to the final round of consideration for a women-in-sf anthology to which I submitted in December, but was declined with a very cordial note. I promptly resubmitted it to publisher #3. As one does.


**Projects out in the wild: 6**



 	
  * Awaiting revision notes on the accepted story.

 	
  * Awaiting editor's response on the other solicited story.

 	
  * "Synthetic Sanctity" is in the second round of consideration for its current submission.

 	
  * Awaiting response on a story submitted in January to a reprint anthology.

 	
  * No word yet on two essays, both submitted in December, both long shots.


**Work in progress:**



 	
  * Finally working on a new novel!  I'm in the world-building, planning, and outlining stage.

 	
  * Revising two solicited short stories.

 	
  * Expanding and revising a non-fiction ebook on habit formation
