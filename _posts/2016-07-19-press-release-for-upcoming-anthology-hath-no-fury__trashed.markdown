Ragnarok Publications is pleased to announce the latest in their anthology lineup, _**Hath No Fury**_, is coming to Kickstarter this summer!

**_Hath No Fury_** will be an epic collection of fantasy, science fiction, and urban fantasy stories by some of the strongest proponents of strong female characters in the industry. These stories feature strong and fearless female leads inspired by women from literature, history, and film—exciting and intriguing characters in the vein of Ellen Ripley, Lara Croft, Joan of Arc, Marvel’s Black Widow, La Femme Nikita, Katniss Everdeen, Hermione Granger, and Furiosa from Mad Max: Fury Road.

This anthology will contain around twenty stories from the movers and shakers of the industry, whose characters defy the stereotypes with which the genre is rife. A few male authors are also included in the contents, specifically chosen because of their works involving realistic and inspiring female characters. With that said, expect to find super-smart, purpose-driven, ultra-confident heroines behind the wheels of all of these tales. Whether they are strong warriors, the silent but powerful type, or the timid who muster up the bravery needed to face down evil to protect the ones they love, the female leads in Hath No Fury will make their indelible marks on readers.

There will also be stretch goals for essays by influencers within the industry.

The introduction for _**Hath No Fury**_ will be written by none other than the great Margaret Weis, who has influenced more than her fair share of female authors and has done great work for women in the publishing and gaming worlds.

_**Hath No Fury**_ will be co-edited by J.M. Martin (editor of the best-selling, award-winning _Blackguards: Tales of Assassins, Mercenaries, and Rogues_, owner and Creative Manager of Ragnarok Publications) and Melanie R. Meadors (fantasy author, blogger at The Once and Future Podcast, and Publicity/Marketing Director for Ragnarok Publications and Mechanical Muse). Both have extensive experience working in fiction and publishing, and have worked on many successful fiction Kickstarters, including _Kaiju Rising: Age of Monsters, Blackguards: Tales of Assassins, Mercenaries, and Rogues, Genius Loci,_ and _MECH: Age of Steel._

**_Hath No Fury_** will be on Kickstarter this summer, and readers will not want to miss this collection of glass-ceiling shattering, ground-breaking tales from a publisher who has mastered the art of delivering awesome anthologies to readers around the world.
