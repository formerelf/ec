Every year since 2009, editor and poet Lester Smith has put together a Halloween anthology of poetry and short fiction. This year's offering will be out shortly, available as an ebook or paperback.
[![lupine-lunes]({{ "/assets/Lupine-Lunes.jpg" | absolute_url }})]({{ "/assets/Lupine-Lunes.jpg" | absolute_url }})I have three poems in this collection: Â two limericks, and a longer poem that tells a story in 13 stanzas, each of which is in haiku format. It's a ghost story, and it occurs on the first night of Obon, the Japanese festival of the dead.

I'll post links when the book is online.
