[](http://www.elainecunningham.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/tatra-national-park.jpg)I soon found another reason to love this project: the elven Forest Kingdom shares a border with the Kingdom of Poland. My father was born in Poland, and I've always felt a strong connection with the culture, history, and folklore. This story takes a new approach to a famous Polish legend: _Smok Wawelski, _the dragon of Wawel Hill.  It also features other spirits and creatures from Polish folklore, which cross over into the Forest Kingdom to complicate the lives of two less-than-perfect elves.

Caves beneath this hill are the purported lair of Smok Wawelski.  In the fantasy version, the caves extend far beyond the real-world caves (shown on the map, below)[![](http://www.elainecunningham.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/smocza-jama.gif)](http://www.elainecunningham.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/smocza-jama.gif), venturing south into the Tatra Mountains and westward into a primordial forest.  Humans no longer remember these caverns, for in past centuries, elves summoned magic to block off human incursions into their lands.

In the deep shade grew ferns, swamp alders and huge fungi. The elves shared the Forest Kingdom with herds of wisent, wolves, wild [](http://www.elainecunningham.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/wisent.jpg)boar, tarpan (a species of wild horse), badgers, bears, moose, lynx, and eagles, as well as creatures and spirits we know only from legend and folklore. _Psotniki, _small f![](http://www.elainecunningham.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/tatra-national-park.jpg)ey creatures who love mischief, lurk in the underbrush. Woodland ponds might provide a lair for _wodnik, _a froglike humanoid_. _Powerful wards keep away most of the spirits and supernatural creatures that haunt the Kingdom of Poland, but the elves remain vigilent against invasion of any kind.

"A Single Thread" provides an introduction to the Forest Kingdom.  I hope you'll enjoy this tale and consider venturing futher into the Kingdom of Legends setting.
