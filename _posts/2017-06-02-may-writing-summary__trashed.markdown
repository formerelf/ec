**Submissions: 4**



 	
  * Revised and shipped a solicited short story.

 	
  * Submitted a short story written in April to market #1.

 	
  * Market #1 was a Nope; submitted to market #2. As one does.

 	
  * Submitted a poem written in 2016 to a literary magazine.


**Accepted: 3**



 	
  * "Burning," a story solicited for the anthology _Hath No Fury_ (Ragnaroc Press)

 	
  * "Royal Daughters," a new short story, was accepted for _Sword & Sorceress 32._

 	
  * "A Great and Terrible Hunger," a story written for _Madness on the Orient Express_ (Chaosium, 2014) was accepted for the reprint anthology _Killing It Softly 2 _(Digital Fiction Publishing).


**Rejections: 3**



 	
  * The story written in April was declined by Market #1, but the editor would like to see more submissions, which is a Very Good Thing.

 	
  * A short story (a rewrite of a previously published bit of flash fiction) was declined by the editor of a themed anthology, but the editor would like to see more submissions and said (paraphrasing), "Don't wait for the next submission window--just send me stuff." That is an _Extremely Good Thing. _Rejections don't get much better than this.

 	
  * The poem submitted in May didn't hit the mark. Not even close, I'm guessing. Probably I should stick to Halloween Haiku and the occasional limerick.


**On an editor's desk: **



 	
  * I'm awaiting revision notes for a short story solicited for a shared-world anthology.


**Work in progress: **



 	
  * New fantasy novel

 	
  * Non-fiction ebook

 	
  * More short fiction


**Writing related:**



 	
  * Sent codes for free _Winter Witch_ audiobook to winners of the April giveaway on Facebook's Forgotten Realms Archive group.

 	
  * May giveaway on the Forgotten Realms Archive group for a copy of _Elfshadow_ in Spanish translation.
