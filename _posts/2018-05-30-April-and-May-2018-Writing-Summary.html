<li>I've been focusing primarily on my historical fantasy novel this spring, so I didn't write any new short fiction and did very little submitting. There's only one story still out in the wild, a reprint submitted to a themed anthology. I did line up two new projects in May. Both are short stories for themed anthologies. One is set in a shared world, the other is creator-owned. June is going to be a busy month!</li>
