<p>Dwarves don't have kings, precisely, but the regional lord holds all the power and authority of a warrior king.  Among the most famous of these, at least among the old races, is Farriandor, lord of a vast territory encompassing the Klimit mountain range and the rough but beautiful lands surrounding Dragonsdive Gorge, as well as the grasslands that stretch between the Gorge and the elven forest to the west.</p>
<p>Traditionally, dwarves have a strong sense of place.  Ties of family and marriage are important, but the clanholds--the lands occupied, hunted, farmed, mined and defended by a community--form their central point of reference.  When naming themselves, dwarves will first list their clanhold, then, if further clarity is required, a clan or family name.  Among dwarves, "Hrolim of Blue Agate Cavern" will usually suffice, as any dwarf of the northlands will surely know what clan occupies any given cavern or mountain keep.</p>
<p>Each clanhold is ruled by a chieftain, but each chieftain answers to the regional lord. Territories under a lord's rule are referred to simply as "lands."  These are nearly always defined by natural boundaries; for example, the Land of Klimit ends where the Starshadow Forest begins.  Dwarves would be puzzled by the notion of defining a territory by the person who rules it. The land of Klimit is what it is, regardless of who bellows orders.</p>
<p>But that is not to say lords are always content with the territories they rule. Dwarves tend to be insular and home-loving, but in their long history some few lords have looked beyond their borders. Farriandor is one such dwarf.</p>
<p>Farriandor is a scholar as well as a warrior, and his particular passion is ancient history. He dreams of reclaiming lost lands, and discovering the truth behind legends. To that end, he has sent out several of his sons to climb unfamiliar mountains and sail the seas in search of  long-lost clanholds. At least one of these is buried deep beneath a thriving human settlement, known to its current residents as Sevrin.</p>
