After several years away from writing novel-length fiction, I'm really enjoying the challenge of creating a new setting and getting to know new characters. That was my primary focus for July, but several smaller works in various stages of development and a surprise invitation to Gen Con filled out the month. Here's the quick summary:

**Publications:** 1
**Submissions:** 5
**Acceptances: **4
**Rejections: 3**
**Projects currently in circulation: 4**


#### **Work in progress:**





 	
  * Writing Draft Zero of a historical fantasy novel, polishing the outline and proposal

 	
  * Brainstorming and plotting an epistolary novella

 	
  * Awaiting editor's notes for a short story solicited for a shared-world anthology

 	
  * More short fiction in various stages of development, _because the story ideas just keep on coming and they will not leave me alone!_


**Publication: **



 	
  * A paid review of _How to Be A Tudor_ by Ruth Goldman, published in _Renaissance Magazine_, Issue #111


**Submissions:**



 	
  * Short story ("Synthetic Sanctity") submitted to _Aliterate_ magazine 

 	
  * Short story ("Dead Men Tell No Tales") submitted to _Ghosts and Pirates_, a reprint anthology by Flame Tree Publishing

 	
  * Book reviews submitted to_ Renaissance Magazine:_

 	
    * _Anne Boleyn: The King's Obsession_ by Allison Weir

 	
    * _The Irish Women's 16th Century Getting Dressed Guide: Wear What the Renaissance Irish Really Wore_ by Kass McGann

 	
    * _The King is Dead: The Last Will and Testament of Henry VIII_ by Suzannah Lipscomb





**Rejections:**



 	
  * "Synthetic Sanctity" was declined by two magazines:  _Uncanny_ and _Aliterate.  _This is a very odd little tale, so I'm not surprised it's taking a while to find a home. Six submissions so far. This story might be strange, but it's persistent.

 	
  * "White Tunic" was declined by a horror story reprint anthology. Again, no big surprise, since the story is closer to fantasy than horror but hey--worth a shot!


**Work done in July to short fiction in the pipeline:**



 	
  * "Burning," a short story for the anthology _Hath No Fury:_  Reviewed copyedits, sent in final version.

 	
  * "Royal Daughters," a short story for the anthology _Swords & Sorceress 32:_  Read page proofs, sent in final version.
