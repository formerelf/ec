<p>Writing is the art of seeing through another pair of eyes. This is true at every step of the process, from creating characters to describing a scene to understanding what agents, editors, and readers want.  For many writers, putting together a query letter is nearly as daunting as writing a novel. Literary agent Kristin Nelson offered these helpful tips on her most recent newsletter:</p>
<p><strong>Fact #1:</strong> Shorter query letters get a better request response from agents and editors.</p>
<p><strong>Fact # 2:</strong> Literary agents rarely read the entire query letter.</p>
<p><strong>Fact #3:</strong> Clearly outlining in your query letter how your story fits in the market will encourage literary agents to read your entire email letter closely.</p>
<p><strong>Fact #4:</strong> A really good title for a novel will catch an agent’s attention.</p>
<p><strong>Fact #5:</strong> A really terrific concept in your query won’t save you if the letter itself is poorly written.</p>
<p><strong>Fact #6:</strong> If you have to defend that your novel is over 200,000 words in your query letter, then you are not pitching your story from a place of strength. And agents are more likely to pass.</p>
