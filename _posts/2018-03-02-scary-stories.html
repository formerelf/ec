<p><span data-offset-key="578rr-0-0">The next anthology sponsored by the HWA (Horror Writers of America) will be a tribute to the "Scary Stories" books, which were collections of old tales and urban legends retold by Alvin Schwartz for the middle reader.</span></p>

The impulse to test ourselves against the terrors of the night is older than human history, and it starts at an early age.Â </span>I bought these anthologies for my sons when they were in grade school. Many of the stories were variations of tales I read, heard, and told as a kid. So that's two generations of good memories, courtesy of the HWA.</div>

</span>The submission period opened yesterday and will close on May 1, and <em>it's only open to HWA members.</em> If you've been considering joining this excellent organization but needed a little extra boost to break free of inertia, this should do it.</div>
