<p><a href="{{ '/assets/images/Cookies.jpg' | absolute_url }}"><img class="wp-image-4040 alignright" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Cookies-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="322" height="241" /></a>I've been baking cookies since I had to stand on a stool to reach the kitchen counter. It's a thing I do. People like cookies, and I like baking cookies for them.</p>
<p>We all have our favorites and preferences. Some people have strong opinions on whether or not there should be nuts in brownies, but in general, no one feels the need to explain or justify the appeal of small, flat cakes.</p>
<p>No one says, "Well, I know it's not exactly <em>haute cuisine</em>, but right now I could really go for a Snickerdoodle." No one prefaces cookie-eating by making sure everyone knows that THEY know that chocolate chip cookies are omg SO FAR beneath them, and that they're fully aware of the more sophisticated delights of <em>croque-en-bouche</em> and <em>Poire à la Beaujolaise</em>. And no sensible person expects a cookie to provide the Minimum Daily Requirement of any important nutrient. A cookie is not a spinach salad and grilled salmon. A cookie is a cookie.</p>
<p>If you don't like cookies, I'm not going to argue that you should. But if you do, please allow yourself (and everyone else) to enjoy the experience.</p>
<p>There might be an analogy here to shared-world fiction. Or not.</p>
<p>Either way, here--have a cookie.</p>

<p><strong>PS:</strong>  The photo is a batch of peanut butter cookies made with European style butter, good Madagascar vanilla, Guiardello 60% chocolate chips, and teeny Reese's peanut butter cups.  I made them for an open gaming event at <a href="http://rivendellbooksandgames.com"><strong>Rivendell Books &amp; Games</strong></a>, our local game store. None of them survived the night. Just saying.</p>
