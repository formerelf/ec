<p>January was busy but quiet. No publications this month, no events. I spent most of my writing time working on the novel-in-progress, and submitted three stories, two original and one reprint, to various magazine or anthology projects. I received one rejection: a reprint poem submitted to a speculative fiction magazine.</p>
<p>Most of my January reading focused on research for the historical fantasy novel. Two notable exceptions were <em>Thunderbird,</em> the fourth book in<em> </em>Chuck Wendig's Miriam Black series, and <em>The Fire in Fiction, </em>an excellent book on the writer's craft by literary agent Donald Maass.</p>
<p>The oft-delayed anthology <em>Hath No Fury</em> has been delayed again, this time to May 1. The new publisher is committed to publishing the book, so I'm pretty confident that it will be out this year.</p>
