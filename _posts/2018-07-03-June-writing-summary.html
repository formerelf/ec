<p><strong>NOVELS:</strong></p>

<p>Finishing up the "first draft" (more like the 57th, actually...) of my Elizabethan-era fantasy novel <i>The Bridge to Alfhame</i>. Almost there!</p>


<p><strong>SHORT FICTION:</strong></p> 

<p><strong>New Stories:</strong></p> 
<ul>
<li>“Honest Trade,” short story written in early June and submitted to a themed anthology. Awaiting editor’s response.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Submissions, Acceptances, Rejections:</strong></p> 
<ul>
<li>“Living Memory,” a story written in 2016-2017, was accepted in final version for <i>Tales of Good Dogs</i>, an anthology of stories set in the Pugmire RPG world.</li>

<li>"Plot Problems,” a flash fiction piece, previously published online in EGM Shorts and heavily revised, was submitted twice. It got a “near miss but send more!” on the first submission, and was accepted on the second submission for publication in <i>Fantasy for the Throne,</i> a reprint anthology of “single-sitting stories.”</li>

<li>“Family Matters,” a flash fiction story written in 2017 and submitted four times in 2018. Awaiting response on sub #4.</li>

 <li>“She Who Is Becoming,” a short story originally published in <i>The Phantom Queen Awakes</i> (Morrigan Press, 2010) was submitted twice. Form letter from a reprint anthology (to which I promptly submitted “Plot Problems,” which they accepted) and a “near miss but send more!” from an ezine.</li>

 <li>"Dead Men Tell No Tales,” a historical ghost story originally published in <i>Sails & Sorcery</i> (Fantasist Enterprises 2007) and reprinted in <i>Memento Mori</i> (Digital Fiction Publishing 2016) was declined by two reprint anthologies.</li>

<li>"Synthetic Sanctity,” a story written several years ago for a shared-world project that didn’t happen. I got the rights back and heavily revised the story to file off the shared-world serial numbers. Submitted three times in 2018. There have been a couple of near misses over its 11-submission history, but this story is Very Odd and I suspect it will probably find a home on my Patreon page. And speaking of which...</li> 
</ul>

<p><strong>PATREON, COMING SOON!</strong></p> 

<p>My new page is set up and ready to launch. No promo work done yet, and I need to reformat a short story collection that’s offered as a patron reward, but the site itself is ready to go live.</p>
