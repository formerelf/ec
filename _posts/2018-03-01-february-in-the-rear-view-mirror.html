February was mostly about plugging along, one day at a time. I'm making (slow) progress on the historical fantasy novel, which is my primary focus these days. I attended my first Boskone, a sff convention in Boston. I met with a local artist and good friend <a href="http://www.baronasart.com">Deborah Baronas</a> to discuss doing some skill-swapping: PR writing in exchange for Patreon and website banner art.</h6>
