![]({{ "/assets/Evermeet-cover.jpg" | absolute_url }})A lot can happen in 14 years. Take Evermeet, for example.

Back in 1998, the island of Evermeet was an inviolate elven homeland, protected by high magic and peerless elven warriors. It had been a refuge for thousands of years, and the elves saw no reason to think things might change. Then, in the year DR 1371 (aka 1998), they got a disturbing wake-up call--an invasion that forced them to rethink their assumptions and shore up their defenses.

Perhaps they did TOO good a job.  When the Spellplague hit, it swept away the whole frickin' island.  But that's another story.

**_EVERMEET Island of the Elves_ **is an older tale, one that begins with the mythology and history of Toril's elves--or, at least, the version of elven history and mythology that the secretive People permit humans to know. The book exists in three layers: a series of tales that follow the history of the royal Moonflower family, the gradual unfolding of the 1371 invasion, and the quest of the book's narrator, the bard Danilo Thann, to give his lover--Arilyn Moonblade, a half-elf of royal blood--some small part of the heritage denied her.

_EVERMEET_ was published in hardcover in 1998 and in paperback the year after. It's been out of print for several years now, but tomorrow, August 7, it will be released in eBook format.  If you're new to this tale, if you want to replace your 13-year-old paperback copy, or if you're transferring your Forgotten Realms books to digital format, I hope you'll consider adding the _EVERMEET_ eBook to your library.
