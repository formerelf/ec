If you love the Forgotten Realms and are active on social media, you're probably aware of two of the best fan sites on the web:  [**Candlekeep**](http://www.candlekeep.com), and the **Forgotten Realms Archives** on Facebook. For the next few days, a post on the FR Archives site offers a copy of the comic book _Worlds of Dungeons & Dragons Vol 7,  _which has two stories:  an adaptation of "The Great Hunt," a story about Arilyn Moonblade and Elaith Craulnober in the forest of Tethyr, and a Dragonlance story by Richard Knack.

[![](http://www.elainecunningham.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/The-Great-Hunt.jpg)](http://www.elainecunningham.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/The-Great-Hunt.jpg)This is my first and only attempt at writing a script for a graphic novel. I spent a ridiculous amount of time on this project, and, as usual, far more research than was probably necessary. The result condenses and deviates from the original story a little. The art is fun, even if the depiction of Elaith Craulnober does not fit his canon description.

Yeah, it's a small thing, but as someone who has found many fictional "second homes" over the years, I understand the appeal of spending time in familiar places with old friends. And I appreciate the people who still visit the Realms, and who count Arilyn, Elaith, Danilo, and Liriel among their fictitious friends.

If you think you might enjoy this particular visit, stop by the **Forgotten Realms Archives** group on Facebook (if you're not a member, you'll need to join) and add a comment to the contest post. Winners will be chosen via a random number generator.
