<p>We played through "Rise of the Rune Lords," the first boxed set for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, during our family game nights, and liked it very much. So I was pleased to learn yesterday that Channa Ti, the water druid from my novella <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy8k9m?Pathfinder-Tales-Dark-Tapestry-ePub"><strong>"Dark Tapestry,"</strong></a> is one of the player characters in the <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9mbg?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Mummys-Mask-Base-Set"><strong>Mummy's Mask</strong></a> boxed set. Here she is!</p>
