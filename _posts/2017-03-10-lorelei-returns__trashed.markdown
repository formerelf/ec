![]({{ "/assets/Lorelei-cover-188x300.jpg" | absolute_url }})Quite a few years ago, I wrote a short story inspired by the Lorelei, a river nymph said to haunt the Rhein. It's set in what is now Germany, before the coming of the Romans, and it explores the nature and the temptations of leadership.

The story has an complex publishing history. Originally sold to _Troll_ magazine, which ceased publication before the story saw print, it was published in 1999 as "The River War" in the short-lived e-zine _The Dragon's Scroll, _and reprinted in 2008 in _Worlds of Their Own_, by Planet Stories (Paizo) and more recently, in my ebook short fiction collection _Just Keep Weaving_.  "Lorelei" is currently available only through the Digital Fantasy Fiction Short Story program on the e-booksellers listed below:
