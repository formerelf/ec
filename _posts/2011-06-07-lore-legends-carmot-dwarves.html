<p>Sevrin's alchemists are fascinated by the discovery of substances in living bodies that are also found in rocks and soil:  iron, copper, zinc.  A certain race of dwarves, the Carmot, also have trace amounts of carmite in their blood and bone. </p>
<p>This rare mineral attracts energy like a load stone attracts metal. Of more interest to sorcerers and alchemists is its volatility; it readily binds with other substances and in doing so, releases energy. Carmite can amplify many potions without altering them.</p>
<p>As a result, Carmot dwarves were hunted nearly to extinction. The long reign of Eldreath, the sorcery who ruled Sevrin until he was slain and replaced by the Council of Adepts, was infamous for its attrocities against the dwarven people. Sevrin's alchemists point to this grim history as one of the reasons for Eldreath's overthrow, as well as an argument against the use of magic.</p>
<p>In truth, alchemists have a keen (if secret) interest in the Carmot dwarves. Gatherers funded by Sevrin's adepts travel throughout the northland, investigating rumors of dwarf settlements and tracking down individual dwarf adventurers.  For a Carmot dwarf, there are few places more dangerous than Sevrin.</p>
<p>The Carmot have several distinquishing characteristics. Even among dwarves, their affinity to  stone is remarkable.  The high contents of mineral in their bodies allows them to find minerals in a manner some elves describe as "like a pig sniffing out truffles."  Some Carmot have the ability to stoneshift: to cut, shape, or move stone through the use of magic.  </p>
<p>Carmot dwarves are natural chameleons, able to shift the color of their hair and skin at will.  Their natural coloring is gray, and when they are not colorshifting, they appear to be sculpted of stone.</p>
<p>Though skilled miners, Carmot dwarves are also fond of travel, trade, and adventuring. They tend to be curious, lusty, charismatic, and possessed of a wry sense of humor.  Carmot enjoy associating with other races. If you find a Carmot dwarf in mixed company, he'll usually be the person in charge, even if he's not the nominal leader. </p>
<p>Carmot are taller than some races of dwarves. A few can pass as short, muscular humans.  Humans find these Carmot physically attractive and occasional liaisons occur, but there are no half-dwarves.</p>
<p>A persistent legend speaks of the last king of the Carmot, an ancient dwarf who has sent his many sons throughout the northlands to reclaim old settlements and find lands hospitable to new habitations.  Most humans dismiss this as a tavern tales. They probably shouldn't.</p>
