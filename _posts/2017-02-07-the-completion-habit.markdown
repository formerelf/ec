[**Here's a link** ](http://blog.gidig.com/2017/02/07/the-completion-habit/)to a post on the GIDIG blog that addresses a key aspect of habit formation, which also happens to be one of my personal challenges: focus and simplification.

I'm currently going through the process of focusing and simplifyingÂ several areas of my life, including writing. One of my primary tasks for February is figuring out what I want to write going forward, and THAT includes breaking the habit of wanting to do All The Things, All The Time.
