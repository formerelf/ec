Thanks to a combination of existential dread and unexpectedly potent darjeeling tea, I had a rare bout of insomnia last night. On the bright side, I figured out how to download GIMP, something I've attempted several times before without success. This is my first, very elementary graphic. It's also the first new Halloween Haiku of the season. (More of those coming in October.) Â I've read that it has a steep learning curve, but if you've used PhotoShop, it's not that difficult--at least, not on this rudimentary level.
