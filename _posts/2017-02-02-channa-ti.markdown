We played through "Rise of the Rune Lords," the first boxed set for the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, during our family game nights, and liked it very much. So I was pleased to learn yesterday that Channa Ti, the water druid from my novella [**"Dark Tapestry,"**](http://paizo.com/products/btpy8k9m?Pathfinder-Tales-Dark-Tapestry-ePub) is one of the player characters in the [**Mummy's Mask**](http://paizo.com/products/btpy9mbg?Pathfinder-Adventure-Card-Game-Mummys-Mask-Base-Set) boxed set. Here she is!
