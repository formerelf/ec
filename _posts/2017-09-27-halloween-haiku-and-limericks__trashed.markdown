For two or three years now, I've been posting bits of seasonal micropoetry. This was prompted by Lester Smith's yearly anthologies of Halloween poetry and short fiction, published by his micropress company **[Popcorn Press](http://www.popcornpress.com/product-category/books/poetry/)**. I contributed to several of these anthologies. Lester is now retired, but I've gotten into the habit of writing small poems around this time of year. Â Here's a warm-up limerick.
