It's a goo![]({{ "/assets/tangled_webs-205x300.jpg" | absolute_url }})d idea to have a basic author bio (more than one, actually, in different lengths and tones), but I always seem to end up customizing. The other day, it was pertinent to note in a bio that many, if not most, of my stories involved elves of some sort.

That got me thinking about the various sorts of elves. Turns out there are quite a few varieties:



 	
  * The Tolkienesque elves of the Forgotten Realms

 	
  * The drow, the Forgotten Realms dark elves

 	
  * Criminally-inclined elves who live hidden lives in modern-day Providence, RI

 	
  * _Linchetto_, the "night elves" of Tuscan folklore

 	
  * There's a short story in the works featuring the _kijimunaa,_ a leprechaun-like elf specific to Okinawa

 	
  * I'm currently working on a new novel that includes a version of the _alfar, _the elves of Nordic mythology.


No stories about Santa's elves yet. That's a serious oversight on my part.
